# Weather‑App Linköping

A frontend weather application built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript — structured for modularity, easy to maintain, and ready for deployment.

## 🔧 Project structure

- `index.html` — main entry point  
- `main.js`, `app.js` — core JavaScript code (handles fetching weather, UI updates, etc.)  
- `style.css` — CSS for styling  
- `components/` — reusable UI components (e.g. weather card, search bar, layout elements)  
- `services/` — code for interacting with weather APIs and external services  
- `utils/` — utility/helper functions  
- `images/` — image assets (icons, backgrounds, etc.)  
- `Icons‑list.md` — list/reference of available icons used in the app  

## ✅ Features
